Data Types : 

To identify data type we use the built in function.

In Python we use different data types like : int, string, float, complex, list, tuple, range, dict, set and bool.

Data types basically specify the type of data that can be stored inside a variable.


Python Numeric Data Type : 

Data type is used to hold numeric values.

int, floating numbers and complex numbers fall under Python numbers.

We can use type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to.


Python List Data Type : 

List is an ordered collections of similar or different types of items separated by commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]

Python Tuple Data Type : 

Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.

We use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple.

Python String Data Type : 

String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes.

Python Set Data Type :

Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by commas inside braces {112, 114, 116}

Since sets are unordered collections, indexing has no meaning. Hence, the slicing operator [] does not work.


Python Dictionary Data Type :

Dictionary is an ordered collection of items.It stores elements in key/value pairs.

Keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.

Dictionaries are declared with {'Nepal': 'Kathmandu'}
