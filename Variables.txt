Variables : A variable is a container that stores to hold data. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored.

Example:  number = 10

Here number is the variable storing value to 10.


Rules for naming Python Variables : 

1) A variable must start with a letter or underscore character.

2) Variable name cannot start with a number.

3) Variable name can contain only alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9)

4) Varaiables are case sensitive.


Valid Variable Names : 

1) firstname
2) lastname
3) age
4) country
5) city
6) first_name
7) _nameFirst
8) num1
9) num2


Python developers use snake case(snake_case) variable naming convention. 

We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word(eg. first_name, last_name, engine_rotation_speed).
