Constants - 

A constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module (a new file containing variables, functions, which is imported to the main file).

Example : Create a new Constant.py File

PI = 3.14

Gravity = 9.8

Create a main file : 

import constant

print("The PI Value is : ", constant.PI)
print("The Gravity Value is : ", constant.Gravity)


Literals : 

Literals are representations of fixed values in a program. 

Literals are often used to assign values to variables or constants.

They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. 

For example, 'Hello, World!', 12, 23.0, 'C', etc.

Example : site_name = 'programiz.com'

here 'programiz.com' is literals
