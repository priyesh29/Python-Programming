KEYWORDS - 

Predefined Words that have special meanings to compiler. Keywords cannot be used as a variable name, identifers or a function name.

Keywords are used to define syntax and structure of python. All keywords except True, False, None are in lowercase. 

ex 1 :yield, while, for, if, else, continue, break, assert, except, await, try, while, with, not, or


IDENTIFIERS - 

Identifiers are the names given to a variable, classes and methods. 

ex 1 : programming = 'Python'

here programming is a variable (an identifier) which holds the value as 'Python'


Rules for Naming an Identifier : 

1) Identifiers cannot be a keywords.
2) Case Sensitive.
3) WhiteSpaces not allowed.
4) Sequence of letters and digits.First letter of an identifier cannot be a digit.
5) Convention to start an identifier with a letter name rather _.
6) Symbols like !,@,#, $ cannot be used.

Examples of identifers - 

score, return_vale, highest_Score, name1, convert_to_string

Python is a case sensitive language which justifies : Variable and variable are not the same. 

While c = 10 is a valid name, writing count = 10 would makes more sense, and it would be easier to figure out what it represents in terms of structure & generic wise.
